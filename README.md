## Usage

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run

    $ npm install -g common-readme

`common-readme` is a command line program. You run it when you've started a new
module that has a `package.json` set up.

When run, a brand new README is generated and written to your terminal. You can
redirect this to `README.md` and use it as a basis for your new module.

    $ common-readme > README.md

This brand new readme will be automatically populated with values from
`package.json` such as `name`, `description`, and `license`. Stub sections will
be created for everything else (Usage, API, etc), ready for you to fill in.
