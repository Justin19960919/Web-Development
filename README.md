## Usage

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run

    $ npm install -g common-readme

`common-readme` is a command line program. You run it when you've started a new
module that has a `package.json` set up.

When run, a brand new README is generated and written to your terminal. You can
redirect this to `README.md` and use it as a basis for your new module.

    $ common-readme > README.md

This brand new readme will be automatically populated with values from
`package.json` such as `name`, `description`, and `license`. Stub sections will
be created for everything else (Usage, API, etc), ready for you to fill in.

## Why?

This isn't a crazy new idea. Other ecosystems like [Perl's
CPAN](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlmodstyle.html) have been benefiting from a
common readme format for years. Furthermore:

1. The node community is powered by us people and the modules we share. It's our
   documentation that links us together. Our README is the first thing
   developers see and it should be maximally effective at communicating its
   purpose and function.

2. There is much wisdom to be found from the many developers who have written
   many many modules. Common readme aims to distill that experience into a
   common format that stands to benefit us all; especially newer developers!

3. Writing the same boilerplate is a waste of every author's time -- we might as
   well generate the common pieces and let the author focus on the content.

4. Scanning through modules on npm is a part of every node developer's regular
   development cycle. Having a consistent format lets the brain focus on content
   instead of structure.
